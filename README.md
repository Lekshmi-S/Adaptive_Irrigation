# Smart Irrigation System ðŸŒ±  

## Problem Statement  
Water scarcity is a pressing issue in agriculture, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Traditional irrigation systems often lead to excessive water usage due to inefficiencies and lack of data-driven approaches. Our project aims to optimize water usage by predicting soil moisture levels and determining precise water requirements for crops, reducing water wastage and enhancing agricultural sustainability.

## Project Overview  
The **Smart Irrigation System** is a machine learning-driven solution designed to optimize irrigation practices by predicting soil moisture levels. By leveraging predictive models, real-time data from sensors, and an intuitive user interface, the system helps farmers make informed decisions about water usage.  

Key features of the project include:  
- **Data Analysis:** Visualizing and understanding historical and real-time sensor data.  
- **ML Models:** Comparing the performance of **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** algorithms to predict soil moisture.  
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface for data visualization, model comparison, and prediction outcomes.  
- **Cloud Integration:** Storing and analyzing sensor data for better decision-making.

## Project Working  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) is transmitted to the cloud using NodeMCU.  
2. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** algorithms are trained and evaluated on the same dataset.  
   - The best-performing model is used for predicting water requirements.  
3. **Streamlit Dashboard**  
   - Displays sensor data analysis.  
   - Allows users to input parameters and view predictions.  
4. **Irrigation Recommendations**  
   - Provides precise water usage recommendations to minimize wastage.
